# On-imputation-methods;using the MICE package (Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011)

This is a code for a simulation study estimating regressions models from a data matrix with missing data (MCAR). This is done through Complete Case Analysis (CCA) and multiple imputations with Mean Imputation, Stochastic Regression, Random Forest (RF) and Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) with 3 imputed datasets. This is done through a Monte Carlo simulation with 100 iterations.
