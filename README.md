# On-imputation-methods using the MICE package

In this simulation study we estimate several regression analysis from a data matrix with missing data (MCAR). We study one true regression model and the same estimated through Complete Case Analysis (CCA) and multiple imputations through Mean Imputation, Stochastic Regression, Random Forest (RF) and Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) with 3 imputed datasets. This is done through a Monte Carlo simulation with 100 iterations
